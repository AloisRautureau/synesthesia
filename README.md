# Synesthesia
> "*The word “synesthesia” comes from the Greek words: “synth” (which means “together”) and “ethesia” (which means “perception). Synesthetes can often “see” music as colors when they hear it...*"

... makes for a neat, light and extremely customizable audio visualizer. 

Tired of the same old rectangles going up and down along with your music? Make it a jellyfish instead! Or anything else that you fancy. Or don't do anything at all, and use premade themes made by others instead!
